Pulsar is a Clojure library that provides high-performance lightweight threads and Erlang-like actors. 
It is a Clojure API for the [Quasar] Java library, with the addition of pattern matching and an Erlang-like syntax.

A good introduction to Pulsar (and Quasar) can be found in the blog post [Erlang (and Go) in Clojure (and Java), Lightweight Threads, Channels and Actors for the JVM](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

Pulsar and Quasar are developed by [Parallel Universe] and released as free software, dual-licensed under the Eclipse Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License.
