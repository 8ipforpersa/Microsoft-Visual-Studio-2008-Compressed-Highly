## Quasar and Pulsar

Pulsar is a Clojure API to [Quasar]. Many of the concepts explained below are actually implemented in Quasar.

## Fibers {#fibers}

Fibers are lightweight threads. They provide functionality similar to threads, and a similar API, but they're not managed by the OS. They are lightweight (an idle fiber occupies ~400 bytes of RAM), and you can have millions of them in an application. Fibers in Pulsar (well, Quasar, actually) are scheduled by one or more [ForkJoinPool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html)s. 

One significant difference between Fibers and Threads is that Fibers are not preempted; i.e. a fiber is (permanently or temporarily) unscheduled by the scheduler only if it terminates, or if it calls one of a few specific Java methods that cause the fiber to become suspended. A function that calls a suspending operation is called a *suspendable* function, and a function that calls another suspendable function is itself suspendable. 

Suspendable functions require special bytecode instrumentation (performed by an instrumentation agent), so they must be explicitly designated as such.
The function `suspendable!` marks a given function as a suspendable function (this operation cannot be undone). The `defsusfn` macro, with the same syntax as `defn` defines a suspendable function.

### Spawning Fibers

To create a fiber of a function `f` that takes arguments `arg1` and `arg2`, run

    (spawn-fiber f arg1 arg2)

`spawn-fiber` automatically marks `f` as suspendable, so there's no need to do so explicitly.

`spawn-fiber` takes optional keyword arguments:

* `:name` - The fiber's name.
* `:fj-pool` - The `ForkJoinPool` in which the fiber will run.
  If `:fj-pool` is not specified, then the pool used will be either 1) the pool of the fiber calling `spawn-fiber`, or, if `spawn-fiber` is not called from within a fiber, a default pool.
* `:stack-size` - The initial fiber data stack size.

The fiber will terminate when `f` completes execution. 

### Joining Fibers

To wait for the fiber's termination, use

    (join fiber)

If `f` returns a value, `join` will return that value. If `f` throws an exception, `join` will throw that exception.

You can also wait for a fiber's termination for a given duration. The following will wait for half a second for the fiber to terminate:

    (join fiber 500 java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS)

The following will have the same effect:

~~~ clj
(join fiber 500 (as-timeunit :ms))
~~~
