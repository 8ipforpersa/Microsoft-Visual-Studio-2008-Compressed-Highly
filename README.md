# Pulsar: lightweight threads and Erlang-like actors for Clojure

Erlang-like actors for Clojure

## Getting started

Add the following dependency to [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)'s project.clj:


```
[co.paralleluniverse/pulsar "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

Currently, there isn’t much in the way of documentation (coming soon!).
In the meantime, you can study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar/tree/master/src/test/clojure/co/paralleluniverse/pulsar_test/examples)
and the tests [here](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar/blob/master/src/test/clojure/co/paralleluniverse/pulsar_test.clj).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co).
