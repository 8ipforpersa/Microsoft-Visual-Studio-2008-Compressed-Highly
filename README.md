# Pulsar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/pulsar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puniverse/pulsar)<br/>Lightweight threads and Erlang-like actors for Clojure

**NOTE: This is alpha software**

Pulsar wraps the [Quasar](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar) library with a Clojure API that's very similar to Erlang.

## Requirements

Java 7 and Clojure 1.5 are required to run Pulsar.

## Getting started

Add the following dependency to [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)'s project.clj:

```clojure
[co.paralleluniverse/pulsar "0.1.1"]
```

Then, the following must be added to the `java` command line or to project.clj's `:jvm-opts`
section:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```

Alternatively, to build Pulsar from the source, clone the repository and run:

```
lein test
```

## Usage

Documentation ( *in progress* ) and examples can be found [here](http://puniverse.github.io/pulsar/).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Pulsar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding the following
to the `java` command line
or to the `:jvm-opts` section in project.clj:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```
